# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I have gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. This is called data wrangling. I have also documented my data wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcased them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.
